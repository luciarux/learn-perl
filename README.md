Snippets of code created when reading Learning Perl by Randal Schwartz, exercises, and more.

Introduction:

Perl is a backronym: the creator, Larry Wall, first came with the short name, and then with a possible expansion for it. Two widely accepted expansions are Practical Extraction and Reporting Language, or Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister. It was created as a general purpose computer language, trying to fill the gap between low level computer languages (like C/C++/assembly), which are very fast, and high level ones, which are limited (shell programming). Perl is easy to use once you learn it, mostly fast and mostly unlimited in power. But Perl is kind of ugly, just like the llama or camel that represent it. It is a very high level language that will be short, and where you can use many contractions, so that it allows writing unreadable code, or „write only” code. Larry Wall doesn’t write code anymore, the language being supported by a team called „Perl-5 porters“. Perl 6 has been released recently, but it’s totally different than Perl 5, also being called Rakudo.

Perl can be used for either short or long programs, and it’s perfect for programs that work 90% with texts. Among others it is good for CGI scripting.

CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, where you can download perl and find a list of all possibilities of installation.
